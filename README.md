# MOEA-D-VOV
 MOEA/D with virtual objective vectors

## How to use
This algorithm works with the PlatEMO. And the algorithm is implemented in the PlatEMO. It is located at [https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/tree/master/PlatEMO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20optimization/MOEA-D-VOV](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO/tree/master/PlatEMO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20optimization/MOEA-D-VOV).
